This is a Work in Progress to create a chrome extension to make GUIDs clickable buttons which copy to the clipboard.

Clicking the front half of the button gives you the clip board copied guid, clicking the back half gives you and excel formatted box.

Copy to Clipboard in Chrome Extension

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3436102/copy-to-clipboard-in-chrome-extension


Using cloud-to-butt as inspiration, it should be possible to make chrome perform a regular expression search on pages... then create a button out of them which upon clicking copy the GUID to the clipboard. This should save 3 clicks and a lot of frustration. An option to append "GUID=" to the beginning of string may also be possible.

Integration with xml authoring tools to automatically perform a search would be neat, but would require more understanding of how xMetal works - even better would be just to open the GUID directly

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'my butt'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/blob/master/CloudToButt.crx?raw=true)

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern.
